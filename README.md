## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the evolution of health insurance coverage across the US states by evaluating Medicaid expansion, marketplace tax credits and uninsured rate changes during the implementation years of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following key variables:
- Total Medicaid Enrollment Change  
- Average Monthly Tax Credit  
- Total Marketplace Tax Credits  
- Health Insurance Coverage Change  
- Uninsured Rate Change  
- Medicaid Enrollment in 2013  
- Impact of Medicaid Expansion  
- State Medicaid Expansion Status  
- Marketplace Tax Credits by State  
- Health Insurance Metrics by Year and State  

## Methodology
This analysis was conducted using Power BI for visualization and Excel for data preprocessing. Data was transformed to ensure consistency, filtered to reflect the years 2010 to 2015 and cleaned to handle missing values. The visualizations highlight relationships between Medicaid expansion, tax credits and changes in insurance coverage.

## Research Questions
1. What was the impact of Medicaid expansion on insurance coverage across different states  
2. How did marketplace tax credits vary by state  
3. Which states experienced the highest and lowest changes in health insurance coverage  
4. How did the nationwide uninsured rate trend from 2010 to 2015  
5. Which states had the most substantial use of federal tax credits  

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant columns and standardized column names  
2. **Data Transformation**: Converted data types, aggregated where necessary and created calculated measures  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Used Power BI visuals to explore state-level trends  
4. **Visualization**: Created bar charts, donut charts and line graphs to communicate patterns  

## Insights
- The total Medicaid enrollment change from 2010 to 2015 was 32.21 million with a peak Medicaid enrollment of 112.78 million in 2013  
- The United States as a whole experienced a health insurance coverage change of 39 million with California and Texas being the top contributing states  
- The nationwide uninsured rate dropped by 2.71 percent from 2010 to 2015  
- States like Florida, California and Texas saw the highest amounts of marketplace tax credits  
- Medicaid expansion states generally experienced greater reductions in the uninsured rate  

## Key Findings
- States that expanded Medicaid had larger improvements in health coverage  
- The federal government played a significant role in supporting insurance coverage through $19 million in marketplace tax credits  
- The average monthly tax credit was 15,000  
- There is a strong positive correlation between Medicaid expansion and insurance rate improvements  
- Uninsured rates are projected to continue declining over the next five years  

## Conclusion
The Health Insurance Analysis Dashboard reveals the transformative impact of the ACA across US states. It provides evidence that Medicaid expansion and tax credits significantly contributed to improved insurance coverage and declining uninsured rates. This analysis provides valuable insights for policy makers, public health officials and researchers interested in health reform outcomes.
